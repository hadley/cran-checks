\caption present without label.
✖ 72: \caption{Figure caption}
(All captions must have a \label and the label must occur on the same line.)

Dash likely masquerading as hyphen. Use -- for a dash.
✖ 7: But hyphens pretending to be hyphens are not acceptable - ever.

IMPORTANT: make sure you are replacing a hyphen with two hyphens, not a unicode dash  –

✖ 9: Sometimes, inline equations are tricky: \(x - (a - b)\) I might - by mistake - but dashes between equations \(x \neq 3\).

Hyphen adjacent to en-dash.
✖ 4: Teachers get stressed when students don't engage in learning -– even

Em-dashes not permitted.
✖ 6: Teachers get stressed when students don't engage in learning — even


Unescaped $.
✖ 4: Some forbidden math $1 + 1 = 2$.
                          ^
If you meant to print a dollar sign, use \$. If you want to use math-mode, use \(...\), not $...$ .

Ellipsis typed without using macro.
✖ 4: A forbidden ellipsis ...
Use \dots{} for an ellipsis, rather than three dots (...) or \u2026 (…).

\label used without prefix.
✖ 1: \section{Example section with a label but no prefix}\label{invalid-prefix}
Use fig: tbl: box: chap: subsec: paragraph: rec: fn: in every label.
✖ 1: \chapter{A chapter with wrong prefix}\label{sec:should-be-chap:}
Unlabelled chapter or \label without chap: prefix.
✖ 1: \chapter{A chapter with wrong prefix}\label{sec:should-be-chap:}
For every \chapter{} ensure there is a \label{chap:...} on the same line.
✖ 1: \chapter{A chapter without a label}
Unlabelled chapter or \label without chap: prefix.
✖ 1: \chapter{A chapter without a label}
For every \chapter{} ensure there is a \label{chap:...} on the same line.

Cross-reference to chapter using Vref or Cref.
✖ 2: \Vref{chap:good} should be \Chapref{chap:good}.
Cross-references to chapters must use Chapref or topref.

Mislabeled or empty cross-references target for Chapref or topref
✖ : Mislabeled / empty cross-reference target for a \Chapref / \topref etc. You have entered a \Chapref to cross-reference a chapter (which is correct!). However the label you have referenced does not exist (perhaps it was renamed or removed?). I saw:
	\Chapref{chap:incorrectly-refd}
Yet the only valid labels are:
	chap:not-correct-refd


Closing quote used at beginning of word. Use a backtick for an opening quote, e.g. The word `ossifrage' is quoted.
✖ 4: 'There is a...

Capital letter ends sentence, but sentence-ending period mark absent.
✖ 165: Many governments have tried to change the GST. But few have succeeded.
Sentences which end with a capital letter need to be signalled with a sentence-ending period. (\@.)

Lower-case \Cref used. \Vref and \Cref are case-sensitive and the lower-case forms are not permitted.
✖ 6: Don't use \vref{sec:some.label}


Hard-coded xref in document.
✖ 6: But sometimes I will. (See Section 5.)
All xrefs need to use \Cref or \Vref (or \Chapref for cross-references to chapters). If you need to use this phrase, you can use a non-breaking space e.g. 'Section~81 of the Constitution.

Use postnote for pagerefs.
✖ 4: This is a citation without a postnote: \textcite[32]{Knuth-A}.


Unnecessary p in postnote.
✖ 4: This is a citation without a postnote: \textcite[][p. 32]{Knuth-A}.


Unnecessary p in postnote.
✖ 4: This is a citation with a double-p: \textcite[][pp. 32--34]{Knuth-A}.


Use of singular form of textcite or footcite.
✖ 5: Should be plural form \footcite{ref1}{ref2}


Page reference not in correct format.
✖ 4: This is a citation with an extended postnote: \textcite[][Chapter~4, p. 32]{Knuth-A}.
Use a tilde to separate explicit page-number references. (e.g. p.~32)
