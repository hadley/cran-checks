DLSODA-  At start of problem, too much accuracy   
      requested for precision of machine..  See TOLSF (=R1) 
IDID=-3, illegal input detected (see printed message).
ERROR: modification of compiler constant of type language, length 5
ERROR: the modified constant is function body:
et(., amt = NA_real_, time = 0.5, cmt = "-out")
ERROR: the body was originally:
et(., amt = 3, time = 0.5, cmt = "-out")
ERROR: modification of compiler constant of type double, length 1
ERROR: the modified value of the constant is:
[1] NA
ERROR: the original value of the constant is:
[1] 3
ERROR: the modified constant is at index 3
ERROR: the modified constant is in this function body:
et(., amt = NA_real_, time = 0.5, cmt = "-out")
Fatal error: compiler constants were modified!
