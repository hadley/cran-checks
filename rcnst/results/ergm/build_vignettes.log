NOTE: Versions before 3.6.1 had a bug in the implementation of the
bd() constriant which distorted the sampled distribution somewhat.
In addition, Sampson's Monks datasets had mislabeled verteces. See
the NEWS and the documentation for more details.

Error in ergm.MCMLE(init, nw, model, initialfit = (initialfit <- NULL),  : 
  Number of edges in a simulated network exceeds that in the observed by a factor of more than 20. This is a strong indicator of model degeneracy or a very poor starting parameter configuration. If you are reasonably certain that neither of these is the case, increase the MCMLE.density.guard control.ergm() parameter.
